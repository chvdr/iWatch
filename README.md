## AI Answer:

If your Apple Watch display has stopped working after being used in salt water, here are a few steps you can take to try and resolve the issue:

- Remove the Apple Watch from salt water: If you haven't done so already, take the Apple Watch out of the salt water immediately. Salt water can be corrosive and cause damage to electronic devices.

- Power off and restart the Apple Watch: Press and hold the side button on the Apple Watch until you see the Power Off slider. Slide it to power off the device. Wait for a few seconds and then press and hold the side button again to turn it back on. Sometimes, a simple restart can fix minor software glitches.

- Dry the Apple Watch: Gently wipe the Apple Watch with a soft, lint-free cloth to remove any excess water. Pay special attention to the charging port, speaker, and microphone areas. *Avoid using heat or compressed air, as it may cause further damage*.

- Place the Apple Watch in a dry environment: Leave your Apple Watch in a dry place, preferably in an area with good air circulation, for at least 24 to 48 hours. This allows any remaining moisture to evaporate. You can also place the watch on top of a clean, dry cloth or silica gel packets to help absorb moisture.

- Check for water damage indicators: Apple Watch models have built-in water damage indicators. You can check these indicators to see if they have been triggered. Consult Apple's support documentation or visit an Apple Store for guidance on locating the indicators for your specific Apple Watch model.

- Contact Apple Support: If the display still doesn't work after following the above steps, it's recommended to contact Apple Support for further assistance. They can provide specific troubleshooting steps or advise you on repair options.

NOTE: Keep in mind that using an Apple Watch in salt water is not recommended, as it can cause damage to the device. If the water damage indicators have been triggered or if the device is out of warranty, repair or replacement may be necessary, and Apple Support can guide you through the process.
